## Rust Guessing Game

This is a VERY basic version of a guessing game made in Rust. The point of this was to create a very basic program to just learn the structure and control of basic Rust. The idea is that this basic application demonstrates some of the most common concepts that you will see in every day Rust code. These concepts include `let`, `match`, external crates, and more. 

## Building

Building and running the application is simple with `cargo build`. The depedency, `rand` will be downloaded first, then the application will compile and run.
